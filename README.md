This example demonstrates a common error in PHP when working with pass-by-reference and strict typing. The function `incrementValue` is intended to increment a value passed by reference.  However, attempting to pass a literal value (10) directly results in a fatal error because literals cannot be passed by reference. The solution shows how to correctly use the function with variables.
